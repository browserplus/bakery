This document will grow.

* Recipes live under ports/

* They are hierarchicaly organized and follow the BSD ports structure:
  * 2 level hierarchy
  * all lowercase names
  * the same logical groups as BSD, no needless invention 

* For now follow the example of what already exists, in the future there
  will be awesome documentation for "porters" (bakers?)
