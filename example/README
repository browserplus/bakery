This is an example project that uses the bakery to build a statically
linked binary that can reformat JSON using the yajl library.
  
Theoretically you should be able to:

1. run build_externals to attain source of and build a static version
   of yajl for your platform
2. run make (or the win32 equiv) to build the json_reformatter binary
