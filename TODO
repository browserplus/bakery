1. clean phase
2. improve driver.rb as a bakers tool
3. error handling:  build should be aborted if an exception is raised
   during any build phase
4. dependencies.  Concretely, libpng must depend on zlib, GraphicsMagick
   on jpeg, zlib, and libpng
5. rebuild guards and "receipts" mechanisms
6. non-build type specific pre and post targets for patching and header
   installation respectively.
